Hey there! I'm 0xjei.

I am an independent ZK software engineer working with [PSE](https://pse.dev/en), building on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/).

My approach is to make technology work for humanity, positively balancing ethics over quick market returns. I mainly invest my time and energy in navigating the dark, deep universe of cryptographic primitives and protocols to create open, high quality, modular software that will serve as the building block for privacy-preserving technologies worldwide.

 🏗️ I'm currently working on [@semaphore-protocol](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol), [@bandada-infra](https://github.com/bandada-infra) and [@zk-kit](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit) - prev [@p0tion](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/p0tion) and [@maci](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci).
 
🗯️ I do engineering and applied research mainly in digital identity, most recently at FHE/MPC.

📚 I am currently learning cryptography and Rust through the books [Real-World Cryptography](https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-cryptography) and [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

👋 I'm looking to collaborate on privacy on Ethereum with startups / research groups / independents on cool initiatives / projects on the digital identity landscape.

Looking forward to [chat](https://t.me/iejx0) / hack together on interesting projects. Cheers and thanks for passing by.
