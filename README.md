hello, Giacomo here.  
Freelancing in applied cryptography engineering on Ethereum.  
Not a pure theoretical cryptographer, not just a full-stack software engineer â€” something in between.

I explore the space between programmable cryptography, engineering, and fast experimentation.  
I love breaking down hard, complex systems into independent, modular, easy-to-use components.  
I build infra, prototypes, modules, libraries, and dev tools.

Always learning in public, feel free to reach out if you wanna discuss or collab on anything.
Iâ€™m always open to meaningful conversations.
